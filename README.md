# Enemy stat adjustment

This mod has two different features: 1. Adjust stats of all enemies without touching the difficulty sliders. 2. adjust combat speeds.

1. Stat adjustsments: If you don't wish so big jumps between difficulties, this mod allows you to manually adjust the stats enemies gain. You use it by opening UMM menu, select the mod and mark the wanted adjustments to all the stats/AB/AC/saving throws you wish to adjust (negative or positive values). At last, make sure "Use adjusted stat" is ticked.

When a enemy monster is spawned, these adjustsments are added to its stats. They will have "Other" adjustment as their description. This can be easily disabled by just putting the values to 0, or jsut ticking the "use adjusted stat"

2. Combat speeds: This part has three options: slow or speed up RwTp Combat, out of combat, or turn based combat. These options actually make the game act faster (so it is not just animations). I mostly made this as rwtp is too fast especially in later game and wanted to slow it down to what i wanted without having to to push ctrl space every time. 
Just choose speeds you want and tick the "Use combat speed". Nothing happens if its not ticked so no issues with other mods.

**Thanks**

Vek17 and their Tabletop Tweaks mod, couldn't understand how to actually do some of this stuff I couldn't dissect and take apart how your mod worked.
